        "\n",
        "You are tasked with developing an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system in Python. The system should generate a 6-digit OTP and send it to the user's email address for verification. Upon receiving the OTP, the user should enter it into the system for validation. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access should be granted; otherwise, access should be denied.\n",

        "Implement a function to generate a 6-digit OTP randomly.\n",

        "Develop a function to simulate sending the OTP to the user's email address.\n",
